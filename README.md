# Skltl
A skeletal framework that focuses on Semantic HTML, not overloading you with new classes and wrappers. 

This is intended to be a bare-bones framework, with no frills bells or whistles.
The objective here is to gather the most common things I use in my projects, and wrap them all into one template.

-    Modular design. CSS has form separated from function, in order to make tweaking easier.
-    Simplicity. No need for labeling everything with custom classes. Just slap on the CSS and there you go.
-    Essential. The core CSS file will contain nothing but the most necessary things.
-    Intuitive. I want to make it so anyone with a bit of experience can understand, use, modify, and extend this framework.

Features:

-    Themes are super easy to swap out.
-    Inline symbols don't need classes to work
-    Images behave much more intuitively now.
-    Apparently spoiler buttons can be implemented in one line of CSS. Huh.
-    Fancy navigation dropdown menu using said spoiler button system
-    Tiny version available. One page, just the backbone.
-    Plenty of Javascript shortcuts for date & time tools, saving a file offline, and more coming soon. [1]

[1] We may or may not be operating on different definitions of the word "soon."
