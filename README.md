# Skltl

A skeletal framework that focuses on Semantic HTML, not overloading you with new classes and wrappers.

This is intended to be a bare-bones framework, with no frills bells or whistles.
The objective here is to gather the most common things I use in my projects, and wrap them all into one template.

- Modular design. CSS has form separated from function, in order to make tweaking easier.
- Granular. Each module should have exactly one job.
- Simplicity. No need for labeling everything with custom classes. Just slap the CSS onto good semantic HTML and there you go.
- Intuitive. I want to make it so anyone with a bit of experience can understand, use, modify, and extend this framework.
- Essential. We're putting the vital stuff all in the same place.

Features:

- Themes are super easy to swap out.
- Inline SVG icons don't need classes to work, just to be part of a text tag like `<i>` or `<span>` or `<p>`.
- Apparently hide-toggle buttons can be implemented in one line of CSS and no scripts. Huh.
- Fancy navigation dropdown menu using said hide toggle button
- Images behave much more intuitively now.
- Plenty of Javascript shortcuts for date & time tools, saving a file offline, and more coming soon. [1]

[1] We may or may not be operating on different definitions of the word "soon."
